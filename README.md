Caesar Cipher Application
A simple encryption and decryption application built using Python and Flask. The project demonstrates the Caesar Cipher encryption technique, allowing users to encode or decode messages by shifting letters in the alphabet.

File Descriptions:
app.py: The core of the application, implementing the Caesar Cipher logic and Flask routes for serving the web interface.
templates/index.html: The user interface for inputting text, selecting encode/decode options, and displaying results.
static/style.css: Stylesheet to enhance the appearance of the web page.

About the Project
What is the Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is an encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example:

Original Text: HELLO
Shift: 3
Encrypted Text: KHOOR
This application allows users to:

Encode text by shifting letters forward in the alphabet.
Decode text by reversing the shift.
